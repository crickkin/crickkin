## I'm NÃ­colas aka Crickkin in the Game Dev Community!

I'm a Programmer focused on the Game Development area, but I also work with mobile and web sometimes. 
I have successfully developed from start to finish some games through the years, 
publishing some of them on Gamejolt, Play Store, and more recently on Steam.
